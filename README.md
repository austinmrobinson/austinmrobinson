# Hi, I am Austin. 

I am a self-taught software designer and engineer living in Austin, Texas.
I am currently a design engineer at [Nominal](https://nominal.io/), where we're building software to accelerate hardware testing.

Before Nominal, I was leading the design system at [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/), focusing on aligning products across platforms and organizations.

Before Tesla, I led design for the design system at [HP](https://www.hp.com/). Our team worked on a ground-up redesign that scaled the system across the company and to multiple platforms.

For a long time, I moonlighted as a designer and front-end developer for [Paper Crowns](https://papercrowns.com/) and my own company, working on projects for companies like Activision and Supercell.
